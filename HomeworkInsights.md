Three trands discovered while completing the homework:

1. People in their lower twenties spent a much greater sum than the rest of the age ranges, but also had the greatest number of transactions. That could be the reason why their sum is so high. This is also backed by the fact that they do not have the greatest total purchase value per person. That title actually belongs to those in their upper thirties. That means that they may have fewer transactions, but they spend more per tansaction.

2. Men spend more than women as an aggregate total; however, women spend more than men per transaction. To add more value to this observation, females make up 14.06% of total players, yet they contribute 15.15% of total spending. This supports the fact that women spend more per transaction.

3. One would think that the most sought after game would be the most expensive. However, not after looking at the data for "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm." It is the most popular item, and yet it has a lower price than many of its counter-items. It is 33% more popular than the second most popular item, and this begs the question, "Does price determine the populatity of an item?"
